# Tanks
My Version of Tanks
The project name is Tanks. 
The game is a single game where the goal of the game is to try to kill the enemies and collect the most amount of points.
To defeat the enemy, you have to shoot bullets at your opponent using your up and down keys to change the angle of your shot.
If the bullet hits the enemy, then that enemy is destroyed and another one genernates. 
The user can also change the type of their bullets and move around the map. However, the players are limited by time
and the amount of bullets they have.
There is also Zombie enemies that when they die they come and help you for a short duration.

You should use tanks.py in the editor
